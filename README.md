#  Smart-Vacuum-Cleaner
> This project demonsterates the use of ROS to build and control an autonomous vacuum cleaner capable of avoiding obstacles dynamically. Below is an overview of the ROS nodes and their > functionality:
##  Features
 1. **Obstacle Detection using Ultrasonic Sensor**
>>> - **Node:**
>>>>   ultrasonic_sensor_node
>>> - **functionality:**
>>>> - Continuously reads the distance between the sensor and the nearest obstacle or wall.
>>>> - Publishes the readings to a dedicated ROS topic (ultrasonic/range).
>>> - **Purpose**
>>>> - Enables the control system to monitor the environment in real_time.
>> 2. **Control Node for Decision Making**
>>>   - **Node:**
>>>>    ''' control_node '''
>>>   - **Functionality:**
>>>>   - Subscribes to the ultrasonic sensor topic (ultrasonic/range) to receive distance readings.
>>>>   - Monitors the distance values and determines if the robot is approaching an obstacle.
>>>>   - Sends a signal to the motor driver via a topic (/motor_control) to:
>>>>>   - Slow down when an obstacle is detected.
>>>>>   - Stop if the obstacle is too close.
>>> - **Purpose**
>>>> - Manages the robot's movement based on real_time data from the sensors.
>> 3. **Motor Driver Communication**
>>>   -**Node:**
>>>>    motor_driver_node
>>>   - **Functionality:**
>>>>   + Subscribes to the control topic (/motor_control) to receive speed and direction commands.
>>>>   + Adjusts the motor's speed and direction accordingly.
>>> - **Purpose**
>>>> + Executes movement commands, ensuring smooth operation of the vacuum cleaner.
##  Workflow
>> 1. The **Ultrasonic sensor** continuously puplishes distance readings.
>> 2. the **control node** monitors these readings and evaluates the proximity of obstacles.
>> 3. Based on the obstacle's distance:
>>> - Commands to slow down or stop are sent to the **motor driver**.
>> 4. The **motor driver node** adjusts the robot's movement accordingly.
